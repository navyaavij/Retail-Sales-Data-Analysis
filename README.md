# 📊 Retail Sales Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing an **end-to-end data analysis** on a retail sales dataset using **Python, Pandas, and NumPy**. The objective was to clean raw data, engineer meaningful features, and extract **actionable business insights** to support data-driven decision-making.

This project was completed as part of my self-learning journey in **Data Analytics**.

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values and removed duplicates  
- Corrected data types (date columns)  
- Ensured consistency in column names  

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Created `Shipping_Duration` using order and ship dates  
- Extracted `Order_Month` and `Order_Year` for trend analysis  
- Calculated `Profit_Margin` for profitability insights  

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis
- Identified monthly sales trends  
- Analyzed category-wise profit distribution  
- Found top-performing products and customers  

### 4️⃣ NumPy Analysis
- Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation of sales  
- Detected high-value sales outliers using the **IQR method**

## 📈 Key Business Insights
- **November recorded the highest sales**, indicating strong seasonal demand  
- **Discount and Profit showed a negative correlation**, suggesting higher discounts reduce profitability
  
- A small percentage of high-value orders contribute significantly to total revenue
